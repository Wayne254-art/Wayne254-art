            <img src="images/Albert_Einstein.jpg" alt="Albert Einstein"> <p style="font-size: 16px;font-weight: bold;">Welcome to this tribute page dedicated to the legendary physicist, Albert Einstein!</p>
            <p>In the vast pantheon of scientific minds, Albert Einstein stands as a towering giant. His groundbreaking theories revolutionized our understanding of the universe, from the smallest particles to the grand expanse of space and time. But beyond his intellectual prowess, Einstein was also a passionate humanist, advocating for peace and social justice. This page serves as a humble tribute to this remarkable man who illuminated our world with his curiosity, brilliance, and compassion.</p>

            <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
            <p>Born in Ulm, Germany, in 1879, Einstein showed early signs of exceptional intellectual curiosity. Despite struggling in a rigid educational system, his independent spirit and thirst for knowledge propelled him forward. He pursued his passion for physics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, where he encountered fellow innovators who would shape his future, like Mileva Marić, his eventual wife and intellectual partner.</p>

            <h2>Groundbreaking Theories:</h2>
            <p>In 1905, Einstein's annus mirabilis ("miracle year"), he published four groundbreaking papers that reshaped the scientific landscape. His theory of special relativity challenged our understanding of space and time, proving that they are not absolute but relative to the observer's motion. The theory of the photoelectric effect laid the foundation for quantum mechanics, while the theory of Brownian motion provided tangible evidence for the existence of atoms.</p>

            <h2>E=mc²:</h2>
            <p>Perhaps the most iconic equation in history, Einstein's mass-energy equivalence formula, E=mc², revealed the profound connection between matter and energy. Its implications were far-reaching, influencing our understanding of nuclear reactions and paving the way for the development of atomic bombs.</p>
